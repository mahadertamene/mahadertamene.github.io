My name is Mahader Tamene
I was born in Ethiopia.

Lived in three continents by the age of 6.
Oldest of 5 (3 biological, 2 adopted later in life)
I was raised in Minnesota, land of 10,000 lakes. People always ask why Minnesota, and oddly enough, 
there's no real answer except that an aunt lived here (product of chain migration -- take that 45!)
